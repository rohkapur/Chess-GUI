# ChessGUI This is a fully functioning game of chess, which I created for my final project of AP Computer Science in high school. It adheres to all the rules of chess. 
In order to move the pieces you must click one piece and then click the spot of your choice. 
If you choose a spot that does not adhere to the rules of the game then your initial click resets and you must click the piece again.
